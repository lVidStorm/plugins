!DO NOT DOWNLOAD FINISHED JAR FILES FROM FORKS!
=====
# Risk notice
Like any other code that you find on this platform you should inspect it and **know what you're running at your own risk.**
any plugins residing in the master branch here have been inspected and used by myself to verify they're not malicious.
**note that other forks can modify their own master branches and could potentially be malicious.**
# Dedicated repository for unfinished plugins
This repository serves as a central hub for developers to share and collaborate on unfinished plugins. Here, you can find plugins in various stages of development, from initial concepts to near-completion.
## target audience
This repository is designed for:

* **Plugin Developers**: Those who want to contribute to the plugin ecosystem, even if they cannot complete entire plugins.
* **Learners**: Developers who want to explore how other developers approach specific tasks and learn from their code.
* **Curious Explorers**: Individuals who are interested in understanding how our plugins are built and work.
## Benefits
* **Community Collaboration**: Connect with other developers to work on plugins together.
* **Reduced Fork Clutter**: Maintains a clean and organized codebase for the core project.
* **Easy Plugin Discovery**: Users can easily find, install, and develop plugins from a central location.
* **Independent Development**: Developers have full control over their plugins and their versioning.

## Installation

some plugins may use side-loading which would need their compiled jars dropped into the client-plugins directory, however most will work just being dropped into /plugins/ in your project setup.

## Fork guidelines
When you fork this project you'll primarily want the main branch, and you'll commit to the main branch of your fork. if you want to PR to this repository then you'll PR your additions to master from your main. If you have plugins that require side-loading, make sure to note that people will need to compile them in order to use them. **do not upload the completed jars.**
